            I am a full-stack engineer from Indonesia. I graduated from
            vocational school in 2020. After graduation, I had the opportunity
            to attend several universities, but I decided to stop midway and
            chose to work due to personal reasons. "I felt that the university
            education system was outdated," that's what I thought at the time.
            However, outside the campus, I still maintained good relationships
            with my teachers whom I consider as mentors. Currently, I am 20
            years old, around 2-3 years after my graduation, and I am now
            planning to continue my studies after meeting some people who opened
            my eyes.

            During my school days, the world was shaken by the Covid-19
            pandemic, and as a result, schools implemented remote learning.
            Since I found remote learning to be ineffective and had more free
            time, I decided to participate in several internship programs
            organized by different companies.

            Although I can currently use several programming languages,
            JavaScript is my native language <span>!!</span>

          <p>
            This interest sparked when I saw my older sibling working as a
            developer at a renowned game company, which motivated me to learn
            game development. From there, I started looking into how to create
            games and stumbled upon C++, which was commonly used for game
            development at the time, but I faced many difficulties in learning
            the language. I discussed this with my sibling, and they recommended
            learning web programming. They taught me PHP, but I wasn't quite
            interested in it.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a while of pausing my learning journey, I enrolled in a
            Vocational High School with a major in Computer and Networking
            Engineering. After a long separation ðŸ˜Š, I reunited with something I
            had left behind, "Oh dear C++" ðŸ˜‚, and it still proved to be very
            challenging to learn this "OLD GRANDPA." I started questioning
            whether this language was suitable for me and sought advice from my
            teachers, "Al-Fariz" & "Hana" (thank you to them!). They recommended
            deepening my knowledge in JavaScript, which was not part of the
            curriculum, and they offered to guide me outside of school.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a while, I began to fall in love with JavaScript ðŸ˜‰. Until
            now, JavaScript has been my lifeline. I am still learning and
            delving into JavaScript up to this day. Yes, even though the more I
            learn this language, the more I realize that JavaScript can be more
            "challenging" than C++, but I still love it "You know, that feeling
            like falling in love with your lover every day" (no, I don't want to
            say this, I'm not that kind of person! ðŸ˜¡). Besides, it's also
            because of the MONEY, ha! ðŸ¤‘. In fact, I have a quote for
            JavaScript, and I will write it in Indonesian below.
